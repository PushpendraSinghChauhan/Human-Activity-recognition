# Human-Activity-recognition
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

How data was recorded
By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial linear acceleration'(tAcc-XYZ) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (tGyro-XYZ) from Gyroscope with several variations.

prefix 't' in those metrics denotes time.

suffix 'XYZ' represents 3-axial signals in X , Y, and Z directions.

Feature names
These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows(sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings.

From Each window, a feature vector was obtianed by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

In our dataset, each datapoint represents a window with different readings

The accelertion signal was saperated into Body and Gravity acceleration signals(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using some low pass filter with corner frequecy of 0.3Hz.

After that, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtian jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ).

The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names like tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag and tBodyGyroJerkMag.

Finally, We've got frequency domain signals from some of the available signals by applying a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). These signals obtained were labeled with prefix 'f' just like original signals with ___prefix 't'___. These signals are labeled as fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyGyroMag etc.,.
